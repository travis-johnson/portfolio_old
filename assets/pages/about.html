    <h1 class="bio">Hey! Thanks for taking the time to look at my portfolio.  Since childhood I've had a passion for technology and creativity.   In the summer of 2016 I decided to take my knowledge to the next level and enroll in The Iron Yard's Front End Engineering course. During my time there, I became proficient in multiple front-end languages and frameworks.  This immersive experience was shared with a great group of people that I had the privilege of collaborating with on multiple occasions. I look forward to taking my creativity and front-end engineering skills I've acquired to become a member of the web development community in North Carolina.  </h1>
